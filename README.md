# Cryptosystem
A simple stand alone application that uses different applications to encrypt and decrypt text
It uses the old ATBASH algorithm and two untested algorithms to encrypt text in English language.
Cryptanalysis has to be carried out for the two untested algorithms before using them on real world systems.
